==========
This program is the teacher side of the Raise My Hand project. When a student raises their hand, their username is appended to the bottom of the list. When they lower their hand, their name is removed. Currently, the teacher IS able to remove the first student from the list. Please feel free to open an issue to ask a question, report a bug, or make a suggestion. Also, feel free to browse code if you wish.
